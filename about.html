      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>
        We, the authors of this site, are two students at the Massachusetts Academy of Math and Science, an advanced 11th and 12th grade school where are senior year takes place at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute, a nearby university. We're good friends, and we tend to like math, science, video games, and a lot of other stuff you would expect of technologically inclined teens. We really like it at our school, and we enjoy the opportunity to bring research like this into the public in an (hopefully) accessible and aesthetic manner.

      <h3>This Project</h3>
      <p>
        This website is being submitted to the Massachusetts Society for Medical Research as part of a contest asking high school students to submit an essay, poster, or website about a recent biomedical research development or breakthrough.  We worked really well together, and we hope that our efforts are recognized by MSMR, but we value the experience regardless of the outcome of the competition.  Thank you for checking out our site, and we hope you enjoy it.
