      <h2>Researchers Use Optogenetics to Eliminate Pain</h2>
    </div>

    <div class='content'>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>Pain. It is something we'll all experience many times in our lives, and yet, we never get used to it. Physical pain is the greatest cause for visits to the doctor's office today; in fact, people in the US alone spend more than $635 billion each year in attempt to minimize their painful experiences. At the moment, doctors are hampered in their abilities to reduce their patients' pain, especially because current pain medications can have detrimental effects for the consumer.
      </p>
      <p>However, a breakthrough may be just around the corner. Researchers at Stanford University have proven that shining certain lights on exterior nerve cells can relieve or even entirely eliminate pain. Although this method, known as optogenetics, involves a new type of treatment in gene therapy, it would have no foreseen side effects, unlike current pain medications. Pain, an inhibiting factor that has plagued mankind for the entirety of its existence, could be drastically limited if not ended completely. Still, because the technology is new, there are still many hurdles to overcome, such as the necessity for gene therapy and adaption from rodents into human test subjects. Nevertheless, the field has the potential to revolutionize how humanity endures pain.</p>
      <div class='highlight'>
        This research will lead to technology that will end unnecessary pain for human beings.

      <h3>Background Info</h3>
      <h4>The Nervous System</h4>
      <p>
        If you want to eliminate pain, it's best to go straight to its source: the nervous system.
      </p>
      <p>
        The basic units of the nervous system are neurons, a.k.a. nerve cells, which communicate with each other in succession in order to transmit messages throughout the body. These messages, which are electrical in nature, carry information from the body's senses to the brain, where the data is processed and then commands are sent, again through the nervous system, from the brain to all parts of the body. The transmission of a single electrical impulse from one neuron to the next is known as an
        action potential.
      </p>

      </div>
      <p>Neurons have three main components to send and receive information: the soma, axon and dendrites. Dendrites are small tendrils which receive the action potentials from other neurons. Once received, the electric signal travels to the soma, and when
        the electrical potential reaches surpasses a certain threshold, the neuron will fire an action potential down its axon, as to communicate with the next neuron in the sequence.
      </p>
      <div class='highlight'>
        If we can control the nociceptors, then we can control pain itself.
      </div>
      <h4>Optogenetics</h4>
      <p>
        Optogenetics is the technique through which gene expression can be controlled via the use of a protein known as opsin.
      </p>
      <iframe class='media' width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Nb07TLkJ3Ww?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>
        Opsin molecules are photo-sensory, meaning that, when stimulated by a light source, they convert the incoming packets of light into electrical impulses. Remember that neurons communicate with electrical signals as well. Therefore, if nociceptors were genetically modified to produce opsin, different types of light could be used to prevent or cancel the action potentials calling for pain! This can be achieved by gene therapy, in which the gene to produce opsin is placed into viruses that infect the cells of nociceptors, and transfer the gene into the neurons' genetic codes. The viruses give the nociceptors the specific gene by cutting their way into the nucleus, where they do some copy pasta, thus putting their segment of DNA code into the DNA of the neurons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scientists at Stanford University, led by Dr. Delp, have used optogenetics to genetically engineer mice whose nociceptors are controlled by differing colored lights.
      </p>
      <h3>The Research</h3>
      <p>
        Dr. Delp and the labs at Stanford University conducted two experiments to test the effectiveness of optogenetics in pain suppression and production.
      </p>
      <h4>The First Experiment</h4>
      <p>
        The scientists in Dr. Delp's lab initially wanted to see whether opsin in nociceptors could be used to cause pain. The scientists genetically engineered mice to produce opsin in the nociceptors around their hind paws. Theoretically, when blue light shines on the mice's hind legs, the mice should experience pain.</p>
        <img src='http://media.salon.com/2011/11/lab-rat.jpg' class='media'></img>
        <p>A few weeks after the surgery, the mice were tested with a system in which they were positioned on a glass table and exposed to blue light. The observers then measured how long it took for the mice to react to the light. The researchers were looking for a flinching withdrawal of the mice's hind paws, as if in pain. The scientists discovered that after only two weeks, the treated mice started to react due to the exposure of blue light. As time progressed, the treated mice began to feel pain and react in as little as a few hundred milliseconds! Pain production was a relative success.

      <h4>The Second Experiment</h4>
      <p>
        To complement their findings in pain production, the scientists at Stanford endeavored to use optogenetics to eliminate pain as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similar to the previous experiment, the researchers genetically engineered mice to produce opsin in their hind leg nociceptors; however, this time, they shone different wavelengths of light at the mice's hind legs, and they found that wavelengths which corresponded to yellow could eliminate the action potentials for pain. Testing the effectiveness of this yellow light was different in nature than the previous experiment.  The scientists used conducted a procedure where the mice were placed on a fine-gauge wire grating on order to test the rodent's sensitivity to stimuli, such as poking and pinching. Exposing the mice to yellow light, the scientists proceeded to cause pain around the hind legs of the mice, and they found that the mice would take longer to react, or wouldn't at all, meaning that the yellow light was inhibiting the creation of action potentials, and stopping the mice from experiencing pain.

      <h3>Future Applications</h3>
      <p>
        Where are the scientists looking to extend their research? In the far future, Dr. Delp and his team hope that optogenetics could be adapted to solve humanity's pain problems. If the technology could work for humans, the cost of medical bills would be drastically reduced and an overall increase in productivity would be seen in the general population. Naturally, the technology does not lend itself to small instances, such as merely stubbing one's toe; but, in larger-scale situations, optogenetic technology in humans will be a huge leap for science.
      </p>
      <p>
        On a broader scale, optogenetics can be applied to more than just pain relief. The technology enables scientists to turn genes on or off via the use of light, a process which is relatively easy to accomplish. Using optogenetics, scientists could have the ability to study the importance of certain genes in behavior. Similarly, via gene therapy, the addition of different genes or differing combinations of genes could be tested at a faster rate. The possibilities are endless! Still, all optogenetic research is based on the ability to successfully conduct gene therapy; therefore, gene therapy much be perfected before optogenetics becomes feasible, but soon enough, you may see some new lights at your next routine surgery or operation!
